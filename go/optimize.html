				<h3>Webtrends Optimize</h3>
				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>For years Webtrends has offered Optimize, an advanced service for running website optimization test. However tests built in Optimize are done so via code only. This made building tests difficult or impossible for marketers and non-developers.</p>

				<h4>Solution</h4>
				<ol>
				<li>Using <a href="personas.html">user personas</a> and customer research we developed a list of features required of a WYSIWYG test editor.</li>
				<li>With requirements in hand we sketched user workflows from test creation through test QA, live reporting, test completion, and test editing. Once the flows were shared and approved by Optimize stakeholders, we moved onto the next step.</li>
				<li>Low-fidelity wireframes were created for the test building and test editing stages of the workflow. The wireframes were then integrated into a usability test. The first usability test was done in-person at the Which Test One conference. Tests were recorded and studied. The results then informed further design iterations.</li>
				<li>The beta version of Optimize Visual Editor was released to customers and we began collecting real-world feedback. The feedback influenced each successive release of Optimize resulting in better user experiences, wider adoption, and a more complete product.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>My Role</h4>
				<p>I began working on Optimize as the secondary designer. Initially I helped build and analyze the first usability tests. Within a year I became Lead Designer and took over all design aspects of Optimize Visual Editor. I conducted dozens of user test and design and helped develop most of the features now in the product.</p>
