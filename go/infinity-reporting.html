				<h3>Webtrends Infinity Reporting</h3>
				<h4>Problem</h4>
				<p>In order to assess their digital properties, users need up-to-the-minute analytics data. Moreover they need to be able to explorer that data in many different ways: adding dimensions, comparing date ranges, comparing audience segments, and more.</p>

				<h4>Solution</h4>
				<ol>
				<li>We began by evaluating user needs. That initial discovery period included user interviews, competitive analysis, and research of existing feedback from emails, forums, and direct contact. We then formed four <a href="personas.html">user personas</a> and their respective stories. The result was an extensive list of requirements.</li>
				<li>With stories, personas, and requirements in hand we began sketching user flows and information architecture.</li>
				<li>With positive feedback regarding flows we next moved to interface design, first on paper and then digitally.</li>
				<li>Using digital wireframes many interactions were tested with users, either in person or remotely. The tests were recorded, analyzed, iterated upon, and repeated.</li>
				<li>Interactions and general layouts were elaborated with interface developers.</li>
				<li>Pixel-specific designs were created and specifications were written.</li>
				<li>Development began. Interface developers, database developers, and I worked closely to build each feature and components in semi-agile 14-day iterations. Each iteration was concluded with a proof.</li>
				<li>A beta version of Infinity Reporting was released to specific customers. Feedback was collected, assessed, and influenced the next stages of development.</li>
				</ol>
				<h4>My Role</h4>
				<p>As Lead Designer on this project I was involved in every aspect of the process and was responsible for most of the details listed above. I conducted research, administered usability tests, designed wireframes, executed final designs, developed CSS, and evaluated customer feedback.</p>
